### Explore page (Main Page)

Whether it is for a first time or a returning user, the explore page always appears first. It includes a list of available restaurant groups around the location preference. The user has the option to search or filter the results (by name, number of attendees, cuisine preference…) using the search bar at the top and the filter icon. An “Add Group” button is available in case the user doesn’t find a suitable group and wants to create his own. The bottom bar allows the user to switch between pages (screens) i.e. Profile, Explore…

### Join a group (without the details)

A quick and spontaneous way to join a group is to simply click on the “Join Now” button without having to go through the group’s details.The group is then automatically added to the “My Groups” section. At this stage, the only information available to the user is the restaurant name, date and time, and how many spots are left in the group.

### Show the group details

In case the user wants to know more about the group, clicking on a specific group will display additional information ranging from the type of cuisine, to the budget (price range). A description (created by the organizer) allows the user to get an idea of what to expect.

### Join a group (after reading the details)

After going through the group details, the user can still join the group. To do that, the user has to simply click on the “Join Now” button. The group is automatically added to the “My Groups” section.

### Search for a group

Searching for a suitable group is one of the main and probably most important aspects of the app. Using the search bar, the user can browse through all the available groups and filter them when needed. After the search has been initiated, the groups are scanned to find the matching results. The number of results is also displayed, the “Add a group” button is removed, and the search results are displayed.

### Filter the results

Here, the user can add additional filters to find the most suitable group. Clicking on the filter icon will open a new window overlaying the previous results and will allow the user to modify the filters based on the desired name, location, date, time, number of attendees, cuisine and budget.
